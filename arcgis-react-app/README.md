# **WV FOODLINK Web Application**

## **Project Overview**
The **WV FOODLINK web application** is a modern, scalable platform built with **React**, **ArcGIS API for JavaScript**, and **PostgreSQL**. Developed as part of the **WV FOODLINK initiative** at West Virginia University’s Center for Resilient Communities, the application addresses food insecurity through interactive mapping, data visualization, and resource accessibility.

This project is designed for **West Virginia** and serves as a **template** for future implementation in other states and regions. Its modular architecture ensures scalability, efficient updates, and performance optimization.

---

## **Usage**
- Explore interactive maps to locate food resources.  
- Filter layers for specific resources like SNAP-accepting stores, food deserts, or fresh food outlets.  
- Analyze trends and insights through dynamic charts and data visualizations.

---

## **Future Updates**
- Expand to support additional states or regions.  
- Integrate real-time data feeds and third-party APIs for dynamic updates.  
- Add user authentication and role-based access control.
